# currency-exchanger

Make an application that contains business logic for making exchange operations between different
currencies.

1. Create models for dealing with currencies, user accounts and exchange rates. One account can have
   multiple currency values. Use `BigDecimal` for performing of exchange calculations.
2. Data with user accounts should be stored as files (one file per account).
3. Separate application functionality to DAO, service and utilities.
4. Create module which will provide high-level operations (manage accounts, currencies, exchange
   rates).
5. Create sample accounts and currencies. Define sample exchange rates.
6. Provide concurrent data access to user accounts. Simulate simultaneous currency exchanges for
   single account by multiple threads and ensure that all the operations are thread-safe.
7. Use `ExecutorService` to manage threads.
8. Make custom exceptions to let user know the reason of error. Do not handle runtime exceptions.
9. Validate inputs such an account existence, sufficiency of currency amount, etc.
10. Log information about what is happening on different application levels and about conversion
    results. Use `Logger` for that.
